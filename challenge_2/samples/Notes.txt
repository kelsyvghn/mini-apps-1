Use Express to build a client-server app that generates CSV reports from JSON data.

The server must flatten the JSON hierarchy, mapping each item/object in the JSON to a single line of CSV report (see included sample output), where the keys of the JSON objects will be the columns of the CSV report.
You may assume the JSON data has a regular structure and hierarchy (see included sample file). In other words, all sibling records at a particular level of the hierarchy will have the same set of properties, but child objects might not contain the same properties. In all cases, every property you encounter must be present in the final CSV output.
You may also assume that child records in the JSON will always be in a property called `children`.


- Use Express to serve up an index.html file and its associated assets

- The client app should be able to submit JSON data to the server, receive a response containing a CSV-formatted result (the way this is done will vary depending on where you are in the challenge).

- Implement all the report generation logic on the server. Do not use any external libraries (such as via npm). You may use jQuery on the client.

* Starting a Node Project: package.json
* Serving up index.html and Assets
* HTML Forms
* Submitting Form Data using the Default Action
* Server Responses based on Form Submission
* Submitting Data via AJAX
* Preventing Page Reload
* Receiving Data as a Result of an AJAX Request

  LET'S GET STARTED:
Setup the html file
 ✔️ - add a title
 ✔️ - link to app.js file
 ✔️ - add form
Set up the server
 ✔️ - insure package.json is setup, by running npm init to setup initial package
 ✔️ - install nodemon
 ✔️ - verify dependencies in package.json
 ✔️ - install express if not installed  (using --save)
 ✔️ - verify in postman or browser that server is up, should receive 'Hello World!' or whatever script res.send you added
 ✔️ - point express to client folder to connect html
 ✔️ - ^ add express use/ middleware with client
 - post user input to the server
 - return the user input from the server to the html
 -
